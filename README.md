# Firebase Tutorial

An iOS Messages app that covers the following:


* OAuth with `Facebook` and `Google`
* Data Structure on Firebase and in Xcode in relation to an iOS Messages app.
* Implementation of `AppController.swift` which is a `UIViewController` which manages the state between logins. If a user is already authenticated and logged in--take them to screen (A). If the user hasn't authenticated (not logged in) then take them to screen (B).
